# The Toyota Object Report

##### A JavaScript Object by Geir SÃ¸nnesyn

## My Initial Thoughts

Recently, I purchased a new used car and found it interesting to use this car as the object for this assignment.

### The Process

To start, I considered the syntax and parts that go into creating an object, as well as the requirements of the assignment. According to the CA delivery instructions, the object had to include:

- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Array
- Function (method)

### Demonstrating Compliance with CA Criteria

To show that the CA criteria is met, I have included console.log statements in the .js file. You can open the index.html file in the browser devtools console to view the output of the log.

## Structure and Usage

My main goal was to create a descriptive object. As I started incorporating the functions (or methods), I found myself creating a comprehensive presentation of the object, which may appear complex at first glance. However, the structure itself is relatively simple, despite its appearance. The use of comments helps navigate through the code and understand the goals of each snippet.

### Dynamic Content Building

To make the presentation as dynamic as possible, I needed to create HTML elements using JavaScript. The code dynamically takes the information from the object and presents it in a meaningful way within the HTML.

Although the formatting of the object arrays is locked into specific HTML formatting, I believe it turned out well. Other data types such as strings and numbers can be added dynamically, generating a new row with respective spans for the property (key) and value.

The primary interactive feature of this presentation is the ability to select an engine type from the dropdown list. Upon choosing an item, a corresponding sound is played back.

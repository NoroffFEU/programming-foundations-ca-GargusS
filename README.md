# The Toyota Object report
##### A Javascript object by Geir SÃ¸nnesyn
***
## My initial thoughts
Recently I purchased a new, used car and found it interesting to make this car my object for this assignment.

### The process
Starting out with studying what goes into an object with regard to the syntax, what parts that it can consist of, and the requirements of the assignment.
According to the CA delivery instructions, the object had to consist of :

- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Array
- Function (method)
***
### To show that the CA criteria is met I have made a console.log in the .js file 
##### Open the index.HTML in the browser devtools console to view the output of the logging

## Structure and "usage"
My main goal was to make a descriptive object. When it came to incorporate the function or Method rather, the ball just started rolling and I ended up with *( for me at least )*, a quite comprehensive presentation of the object. The complexity of this presentation may have gone a little south, and I lost myself for a couple of hours in there, but the structure is quite simple, it just *looks* advanced. Using comments to point out the goal for the snippet, makes everything easier to navigate.

### Dynamic content building
Knowing from previous projects that to make this presentation as dynamic as possible, I needed to make html elements with JavaScript. A dynamic code that took the given information in the object and treated it in a manner that makes sense in the HTML.

Even though I have "locked" the formatting of the objects arrays to specific HTML formatting, I think this came out quite OK. The other entities such strings and number can be added dynamically and an new row with the respective spans for property (key) and value is generated.
